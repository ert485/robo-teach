# RoboTeach

An educational robotics platform using the MakersPet robot with ROS2 to create interactive learning experiences for children. This project aims to make robotics accessible for educational activities that improve spatial reasoning, creativity, persistence, and problem-solving skills.

## 🤖 About the Project

This repository contains the setup, scripts, and documentation for controlling a MakersPet robot through ROS2 commands. The robot features:
- 120mm round differential drive base
- 360° 2D LiDAR sensor for mapping and navigation
- ESP32 development board
- Docker-based ROS2 environment for cross-platform compatibility

## 🎯 Educational Goals

The platform targets key learning outcomes:
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Understanding robot movement and navigation
- **Perseverance**: Debugging and problem-solving with robotics
- **Creativity**: Designing custom robot behaviors and activities  
- **Sequencing**: Programming logical command sequences

## 🚀 Getting Started

To initially program a robot, you will need to follow the instructions provided by Makerspet and Kaia.ai. 
If you have a robot that is already assembled and programmed, complete the steps provided by Makerspet to connect the robot to the WiFi network that you will be using.

If you robot is already connected to a WiFi network, you can start here:

### Prerequisites
- macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Docker installed
- XQuartz (for macOS visualization)

### Setup

1. **Set your machine's IP address:**
   ```bash
   export IP=$(ifconfig en0 | grep inet | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}')
   ```

2. **Configure X11 for visualization (macOS specific instructions):**
   - Start XQuartz
   - Add your IP to the access control list:
     ```bash
     /opt/X11/bin/xhost + $IP
     ```

3. **Launch the Docker container:**
   ```bash
   docker run --platform linux/amd64 --name makerspet -it --rm -v ~/maps:/maps \
     -p $IP:8888:8888/udp \
     -p 4430:4430/tcp \
     -e DISPLAY=$IP:0 -e LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0 \
     kaiaai/kaiaai:iron
   ```

4. **Initialize robot communication:**
   ```bash
   ros2 launch kaiaai_bringup physical.launch.py
   ```

5. **Test basic movement:**
   ```bash
   bash move-forward.sh
   ```

### Additional Terminal Access
To run multiple terminals in the same Docker container:
```bash
docker exec -it makerspet bash
```

## 🛠 Common Commands

### Robot Control
```bash
# Manual keyboard control
ros2 run kaiaai_teleop teleop_keyboard

# Basic forward movement
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.1, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}"

# Stop the robot
ros2 topic pub --once /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}"
```

### Debugging
```bash
# Check available topics
ros2 topic list

# Monitor robot communication
sudo tcpdump -i any -n port 8888

# View topic information
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Known Limitations

- Move Command only works 50% of the time - see `challenges-and-learnings.md` 

### Common Issues

**ESP32 not connecting to laptop:**
- Check network connectivity with `tcpdump`

**WiFi connection issues:**
- Connect via USB cable and use Arduino Serial Monitor
- May need to remove LiDAR sensor to access USB port

**Cross-platform development:**
- Use the provided Docker image for consistent environment
- Set up proper IP forwarding for your operating system

See `challenges-and-learnings.md` for detailed troubleshooting information.

## 🎮 Educational Activities

This platform has a vision to enable various educational activities:
- **Treasure Hunt**: Robot navigates to find hidden objects using SLAM
- **Art Creator**: Children program movement patterns to create drawings
- **Maze Runner**: Problem-solving through obstacle navigation
- **Pet Follower**: Robot learns to follow and interact with children
