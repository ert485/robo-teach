Imagine we are shipping a fully polished product, that teachers can use easily for games and activities that the children can interact with a robot.

Our product uses a robot that has wheels and a 2D 360 degree LiDAR.  ROS2 commands behind the scenes are controlling the robot, but the children can interact with it in a way that makes sense for them.

What does it look like for the children, how do they use it, what can the robot do? Focus on games and activities that improve learning outcomes like "Spatial Reasoning", "Perseverance / persistence", "Creativity / Art", "Sequencing / Classifying / Categories"

Can you describe what ROS2 commands/features one of those activities would be using? I'm trying to describe to others in technical terms what ROS2 and the LiDAR capability does to help make those activities possible.

ALTERNATE TO ABOVE - kaia.ai commands

Can you describe what kaia.ai commands/features one of those activities would be using? I'm trying to describe to others in technical terms what kaia.ai and the LiDAR capability does to help make those activities possible.

Expand on this (From what I found kaia might not have many pre-built commands like this, but it does seem like it is intended to be high level robotics actions):

"Educational-friendly interfaces that abstract complex robotics into child-accessible interactions"

Try to explain it in simple terms that make sense for the activity, rather than describing the tech
