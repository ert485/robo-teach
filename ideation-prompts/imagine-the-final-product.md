Imagine we are shipping a fully polished product, that teachers can use easily for games and activities that the children can interact with a robot.

Our product uses a robot that has wheels and a 2D 360 degree LiDAR.  ROS2 commands behind the scenes are controlling the robot, but the children can interact with it in a way that makes sense for them.

What does it look like for the children, how do they use it, what can the robot do? Focus on games and activities that improve learning outcomes like "Spatial Reasoning", "Perseverance / persistence", "Creativity / Art", "Sequencing / Classifying / Categories"
